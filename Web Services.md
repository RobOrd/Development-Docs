# Web Services

### Concepts

#### API REST
A RESTful API is an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data.

A RESTful API also referred to as a RESTful web service is based on representational state transfer (REST) technology, an architectural style and approach to communications often used in web services development.

An API for a website is code that allows two software programs to communicate with each another. The API spells out the proper way for a developer to write a program requesting services from an operating system or other application.
