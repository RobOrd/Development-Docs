# Architecture #

### The Model ###
- The model represents core business logic and data
- Models encapsulate the properties and behavior of a domain entity and expose properties that describe the entity

### The View ###
- The view is responsible for transforming a model or models into a visual representation
- Views should concentrate only on displaying data
and should not contain any business logic themselves

### The Controller ###
- The controller, as the name implies, controls the application logic and acts as the coordinator between the view and the model
- Controllers receive input from users via the view, then work with the model to perform specific actions, passing the results back to the view.

### Whatâ€™s New in ASP.NET MVC 4 ###
- Asynchronous controllers
- Display modes
- Bundling and minification
- Web API
